What?! That's So Many Replays (tm)!
====================================

Replayniac will raise your Starcraft II replay hunger. To the unbearable level.

While navigating replay sites you ever thought "man, I wish I could download
*all* these sick replays from this sick guy with a single click", and you don't
even have nearly enough time you'd need to watch them all? Replayniac will make
it happen!

You ever wondered if you were wasting time because you kept downloading replays
and not even watching them? Replayniac will help you out with this by reducing
thousands of clicks on replay links to a single one! And you'll never gonna
watch them anyway!

On a serious note, the purpose of this extension is to be able to perform the
following workflow:

* Perform a search for a player/matchup/race/map/player color/whatever on a replay site
* Be able to download them all as fast and as simple as possible

When you mark checkboxes and hit the "download them all" button, a window will
open and new tabs will be created on it, always keeping a maximum amount of
tabs open at a time. This amount is configurable under extension's options
(you'll need to set this to a lower value if your internet connection is slow
or if you're using a slow computer).

The extension expects the browser to close the tabs automatically after the
downloads start, so it can start new downloads right away. Please read below
for exceptions of this case and please report if anything doesn't work.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO EXTENSION FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------------------------------

For certain sites, and I'm not sure why, Chrome will not automatically close
the tab that the extension used to open a new file for download. If you see
that happening (downloads starting but no tabs closing on the Replayniac
"download manager"), then you'll need to close them manually for the other tabs
start opening!

Sites known for manually closing of download tabs:

* gosugamers.net

Some of the mentioned sites below will only show checkboxes and the "download
all" link after you make a search like that.

Currently working replay sites are (as of May 2011):

* http://www.sc2rep.com
* http://sc2-replays.net
* http://gosugamers.net/starcraft2/replays
* http://sc2.replays.net/replay/replaylist.aspx
* http://www.gamereplays.org/starcraft2/replays.php?game=33

Replay sites that won't need Replayniac, cause they already want to blow your
mind with billions of replays, therefore are highly recommended:

* http://www.sc-replay.com

(Taken as directed, Replayniac provides uninterrupted sleep without
morning-after grogginess. You awaken fresh, ready to tackle all those little
annoying problems facing you. Do not exceed recommended dosage. [\*])
